# CI/CD Workshops

## Plan

1. What is CI/CD  
  * Differences between Continuous Delivery and Continuous Deployment  
  * Branching strategies  
  * Testing strategies  
  * Delivery strategies  
2. Continuous Delivery patterns  
3. On-prem, SaaS, or? Different ways of hosting CI/CD workloads  
4. Use of open source in Continuous Delivery 
  * GitHub Actions
  * Testing frameworks
  * Performance testing frameworks
  * Quality testing frameworks
5. Enable scale in Continuous Delivery 
  * Modularization
  * Pull Requests and decision automation
  * Access Control
  * Monitoring
6. When to run your pipelines?
7. IaC pipelines
  * Create/update of the infrastructure
  * Drift detection
8. Evolve the Continuous Delivery
  * Measure the Continuous Delivery
  * SBOM generation
  * AI (?)

## Needs

-	Enough power cords
-	Screen for presentations
-	Internet access
-	Whiteboard (and pens)
-	Depends on the size of the audience – 4 or more tables (for all people)


## Practical exercises

1.	Pros and cons of Trunk based branching strategy (Liberating structures, 1-2-4-all) – (Plan 1.)
2.	Pros and cons of Blue/Green deployment (Liberating structures, 1-2-4-all) – (Plan 1.)
3.	What you absolutely do and absolutely avoid to achieve proper delivery process (Liberating structures, Min Specs) – (Plan 2)
4. Build your pipeline (plan 2)
4.	Build the pipeline using GitHub Actions - (Plan 4., code) 
a.	Needed: find a fully functional code example with tests in GitHub
5.	Use third-party Actions in GHA – (Plan 5., code)
6.	Pull Request with SonarQube - (Plan 5., code)
7.	Secure branches – (Plan 5., code)
8.	Pipelines for IaC – (Plan 7., code)
