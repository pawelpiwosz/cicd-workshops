# Create three test pyramids

## Purpose

To ensure proper knowledge of test strategies through DevOps pipelines.

## Rules

Groups: depends how many sets do we have.

Each group has to create three "pyramids", for: functional, non-functional and security tests. This is the first selection.

Second selection - all three pyramids must be set by time and costs. Fastest and cheapest test type on the bottom of the pyramid, longest and most expensive on top.

## Time frame

10 minutes

## Output

Better understanding of three types of tests and implications of their placement in development cycle.
